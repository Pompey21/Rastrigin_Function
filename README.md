# Rastrigin_Function
This is my favourite function - the Rastrigin function. What sparked my curiosity and interest in the function was its complexity in terms of many local optimum points, which makes it particularly interesting and useful for testing any optimisation algorithms.
However, it only has one optimum (minimum) value at (x=0, y=0) but many local minima nearby.

Bellow are two pictures of the function itself, in both a 2D and 3D format!
